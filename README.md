- 👋 Hi, I’m Ben Smith @smeeeeth -

@smeeeeth was a name i've had since school as my surname (Smith) is so common that they couldn't log me onto the school system, so some friends suggested they put me in as smeeeeth.

I have been working in digital media on the agency, publisher and technology side for over a decade, more recently in the martech world too. I have worked in operational teams, account management and sales teams and been a leader / manager of teams across different timezones. 

👀 I’m interested in learning to code. predomiantely becasue i love to learn new things (1-2 hours a day) and like to keep up the diciplin of leanirng. I've no current ambitions to be software dev. Just find the challenge of solving pronblems addictive and there is so much contetn to consume around it. I find it helps me approah challenges in my professional life with a different view. You should try it...

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on:
- Sales tech interests me as Its what I know, there are lots of tools out there that do a bit of the job. 
- Music is a passion, I like the diffferent DAW that musicians have access to, im currently leanirng how to use synths and digital music systems
- Games and gaming have always been a hobby too
